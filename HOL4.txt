documentation {
  - document PairCases_on
  - write down the exact format required for congruence theorems (for add_cong)
  - document the relatively new Parse functions for overloads and abbrevs (e.g.
    pp_overloads_on)
  - improve Parse.add_rule documentation
}
formalizations {
  - Coq logic within HOL (proof theoretic)
  - Coq semantically
  - traditional unification algorithm to complement what's in
    examples/unification
  - category theory
  - CERN LHC SRS
  - martelli montanari unification (+ time complexity)
  - "Structural Recursion with Locally Scoped Names" (requires nominal datatype
    package)
  - (descriptive) complexity theory
}
minor hacking {
  - =+ for finite maps, rewrites combinTheory.UPDATE (email id
    4C77593C.7060407)
  - replace Coding (for LoadableThyData) with Pickle or something more
    sophisticated
  - check a possible absyn postprocessing bug
  - investigate an error in new_recursive_definition (not sure what this is now)
  - clean up the tools, tools-poly, tools/poly etc. directory layout/contents
  - TeX and Unicode for BIGUNION and BIGINTER
  - make Binarymap have the same interface as Redblackmap
  - tool to find undocumented but visible (i.e. in signatures) functions
}
major hacking {
  - use proforma theorems to improve HolQbf validity checking complexity
  - fix imp_res_tac: it gives you too much stuff
  - fix SATISFY_ss: it doesn't do backward chaining properly
  - hol light kernel
  - open theory writer (probably requires the above)
  - nominal datatype package
  - make HOL4 run on MLton (probably need to write a repl or use Hamlet)
  - experiment with using Isar or some other DSL for script files
  - implement locales somehow (possibly requires the one above)
  - port sledgehammer
  - how to enable monadsyntax all the time? which one? (don't know exactly what
    this means)
  - experiment with overloading instead of defining constants (especially in
    relationTheory)
